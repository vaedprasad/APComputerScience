LipogramsA lipogram (from Greek lipagrammatos, “missing letter”) is a kind of writing with constraints or word game consisting of writing paragraphs or longer works in which a particular letter or group of letters is missing, usually a common vowel, the most common in English being e.“Gadsby is a notorious book by Californian author E. V. Wright, circa 1939. It was Wright’s fourth book. It is famous for consisting only of words not containing any e’s. Gadsby is thus a lipogram, or a display of constraint in writing. It is 50,100 words long, Wright informs us in Gadsby’s introduction of having had to impair his own typing contraption to avoid slipups.”On the following page there is an excerpt included from Chapter 1.The Lipogrammer program helps to create and verify lipograms. It shows the original text, below it the same text wth all letters e replaced with #, and to the right, the list of all ‘offending’ words (with an e in them). The user can load a lipogram text from a file or type it in or cut and paste it from another program. There is also a menu command to save the text. In this lab you will write the LipogramAnalyzer class for this programThe LipogramAnalyzer should have the following constructor and two public methods:Constructor Summarypublic LipogramAnalyzer(String text) Saves the text string.Method SummaryStringmark(char letter)Returns the saved text string with all characters equal to letterreplaced with ‘#’.StringallWordsWith(char letter)Returns a string that concatenates all “offending” words from textthat contain letter; the words are separated by ‘\n’ characters; the returned string does not contain duplicate words: each word occurs only once; there are no punctuation or whitespace characters in the returned string other than ‘\n’ characters.Hint: write a private method to extract and return the word that contains the character at a specified position in text. Find the boundaries of the word by scanning the text to the left and to the right of the given position.Combine in one project your LipogramAnalyzer class with the Lipogrammer and LipogrammerMenu GUI classes given on Haiku. Test the program.





Excerpt from “Gadsby”If Youth, throughout all history, had had a champion to stand up for it; to show a doubting world that a child can think; and, possibly, do it practically, you wouldn't constantly run across folks today who claim that "a child don't know anything." A child's brain starts functioning at birth; and has, amongst its many infant convolutions, thousands of dormant atoms, into which God has put a mystic possibility for noticing an adult's act, and figuring out its purport.Up to about its primary school days a child thinks, naturally, only of play. But many a form of play contains disciplinary factor. "You can't do this," or "that puts out out," shows a child that it must think, practically, or fail. Now, if, throughout childhood, a brain has no opposition, it is plain that it will attain a position of "status quo," as with our ordinary animals. Man knows not why a cow, dog, or lion was not born with a brain on a par with ours; why such animals cannot add, subtract, or obtain from books and schooling, that paramount position which Man Holds today.But a human brain is not in that class. Constantly throbbing and pulsating, it rapidly forms opinions; attaining an ability of its own; a fact, which is startlingly shown by an occasional child "prodigy" in music or school work. And as, with our dumb animals, a child's inability convincingly to impart its thoughts to us, should not class it as ignorant.Upon this basis I am going to show you how a bunch of bright young folks did find a champion; a man with boys and girls of his own; a man of so dominating and happy individuality that Youth is drawn to him as is a fly to a sugar bowl. It is a story about a small town. It is not a gossipy yarn; nor is it a dry, monotonous account, full of such customary "fill-ins" as "romantic moonlight casting murky shadows down a long, winding country road." Nor will it say anything about tinklings lulling distant folds; robins carolling at twilight, nor any "warm glow of lamplight" from a cabin window. No. It is an account of up- and-doing activity; a vivid portrayal of Youth as it is today; and a practical discarding of that worn-out notion that "a child don't know anything."Now, any author, from history's dawn, always had that most important aid to writing:—an ability to call upon any word in his dictionary in building up his story. That is, our strict laws as to word construction did not block his path. But in my story that mighty obstruction will constantly stand in my path; for many an important, common word I cannot adopt, owing to its orthography.
